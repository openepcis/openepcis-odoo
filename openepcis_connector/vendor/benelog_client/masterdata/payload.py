"""Building the nested catalog document from path/value pairs.

The catalog wants nested JSON keyed by GS1 Web Vocabulary local names::

    brand.brandName                                  -> {"brand": {"brandName": ...}}
    countryOfOrigin.countryCode                      -> {"countryOfOrigin": {"countryCode": "DE"}}
    targetMarket[].targetMarketCountries.countryCode -> {"targetMarket": [{...}]}

A ``[]`` segment means "a single-element list", which is how the catalog
models target markets, contact points and referenced files.

Reading values out of the host system is the host adapter's job; this module
only knows how to place a value at a dotted path and how the catalog wants a
few awkward value kinds shaped. The catalog treats ``PUT`` as a merge where an
absent key means "leave alone", so hosts skip empty values rather than sending
``null``; the shaping helpers answer ``None`` for a value that must be skipped.
